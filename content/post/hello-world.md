Welcome to my personal blog. I’ll be writing about AI engineering, coding practices, and what I’m building. Stay tuned!

My name is Johannes, and I am fascinated by many things. I love to go down rabbit holes and learn all there is to know about all kinds of subjects.

One topic that fascinates me the most is AI.

I remember Alpha Go beating the world champion like it was yesterday. I was watching YouTube when I stumbled across this breakthrough in deep reinforcement learning. An AI system had not only matched human performance, it had reached superhuman levels of performance.

Now that real-world research had made a such a monumental breakthrough toward powerful AI, interest amongst young people like was especially high.

That’s when I made the most important decision for my career: I decided to learn computer science and artificial intelligence. I wanted to be part of the automation revolution that I believed would eventually change the world.

Before ChatGPT came out, I started working on machine learning use cases for my company and my bachelor’s thesis. During the early release of ChatGPT, I was there and told all my friends and family that the world was about to change.

Now I work with Artificial Intelligence professionally, and I am pursing a master’s degree in AI on the side.

I love to share my knowledge and ideas about AI with others.

If there’s one message that I want to share, it is this: this is the best time to learn new things online. AI can empower anyone to learn faster than they ever have.

All that current AI can do is execute learned programs, it cannot synthesize new algorithms to solve new problems. This limitation will eventually be overcome, although it is difficult to know when it will be solved.

Human intelligence beats artificial intelligence at solving new tasks, and it probably will for quite some time.

The best use of AI is learning new skills and facts at a faster pace.

If you’re interested in learning more about AI, follow me and stay tuned for creative ways to use AI to reach new heights.
